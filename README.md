**The Idea behind it:** sometimes you can't seem to find a 5 minute part in a 2 or 3 or 4 hour lecture which you require and you spend most of your time finding out where is that five minute part located or you watch the whole video. This project helps you to find that five minute part and save some hours of a students precious time

Smart recorder allows you to search through audio in an instant. This is especially handy when you have to listen to a 3 or 4 or 5 hour lecture but you don't have time or you are lazy ðŸ˜‚. This works by generating a transcript for the youtube video and you can **search** through the transcript and only read the part you want.
